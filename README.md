# Epistemic Graph Neural Network for systematic generalisation problems

## Getting started

Depending on how big this project will eventually get, we offer this project as `dev` package that can be built in editable mode:

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages below

```python3
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # for linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate # for windows
pip install -e .
```
Also install the following packages using the link relevant for your hardware:
```
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+${CUDA}.html
```
e.g. `CUDA=cpu` for a machine without a gpu. See https://pypi.org/project/torch-sparse/ 

## To reproduce results in the paper just build and run the following command in `src`


```python
python train.py experiments=`pick a dataset model config file from configs/experiments`
```

The config can be easily adjusted from the command line using a dot file path notation with the `experiments.` prefix. For example, running for 10 epochs on the rcc8 dataset amounts to:
```
python train.py experiments=fb_model_rcc8 experiments.epochs=10
```
